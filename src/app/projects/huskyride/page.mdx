## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.

At UW, the high volume of student who commute to school contribute to problems such as 
severe traffic congestions, rising transportation costs, and increased environmental 
damage. Carpooling is a great option to alleviate these issues, but students, 
especially newcomers who do not have an established social network at UW yet, 
may find it challenging to seek compatible carpool buddies due to different class 
schedules and safety concerns. Thus, many students avoid this by just opting to drive 
alone, which causes them to miss out on carpooling incentives UW provides, worsens 
traffic, and contradicts with UW’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

The carpool matching system mobile application is designed to organize and facilitate 
carpooling arrangements for both drivers and riders. This application enables users to 
reduce transportation costs and foster new connections through finding compatible 
carpooling groups and splitting transportation costs. Users can quickly sign up 
and verify their identity using UW for existing community as a step towards safety, 
find nearby carpool groups, and begin carpooling.

## Design Walkthrough

Our resulting design is a carpool matching system mobile application crafted to 
facilitate carpooling arrangements for both drivers and riders, with a focus on 
convenience, and flexibility. By connecting users within the UW community, the app 
encourages cost-effective transportation and builds social connections through 
compatible carpool groups. It effectively addresses common carpooling challenges, 
such as late arrivals and unexpected delays, by incorporating features like grace 
period timers, alternative arrangements for delayed drivers, and options for riders 
to quickly find new carpool options when needed. This comprehensive design ensures 
a seamless, reliable, and user-friendly carpooling experience for everyone involved.


Our two primary tasks appeared as follows:

### Task 1:  Late Ride Exception Handling

Task 1 allows for flexible management of delays at the pickup location, ensuring both drivers 
and riders have a fair system for handling tardiness. When the driver arrives, a grace period 
timer begins, giving the rider a specified amount of time to show up. If the timer expires, 
the driver can choose to cancel the ride or extend the grace period in minute-long increments. 
This task provides a structured way to manage delays while offering both parties the flexibility 
to adapt to unforeseen circumstances.

        },
        {

        "Increasing grace period for a late rider"
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Task 2: Handling unexpected carpool delays and alternative arrangements

Task 2 ensures flexibility and options for riders when a driver is delayed. 
If the driver encounters a delay, the rider can choose to either continue waiting 
or seek an alternative carpool. Once the delayed driver arrives at the rider’s 
location, the pre-selected timer set by the driver will begin, providing a clear 
and structured timeline for the pickup process. This task helps maintain efficiency 
and transparency while accommodating unforeseen disruptions.

## Design Research and Key Insights

The goal of our design research was to gain insights on how commuter students currently plan 
and organize their carpooling arrangements and what are key factors that motivate or deter 
students from choosing carpooling as their mode of transportation. Our method of research is 
to conduct two types of interviews, specifically targeting those who have experience 
carpooling or are currently doing so. Each interview aims to gain more individualized, 
in-depth insights into their commuting habits, carpool preferences, and any perceived 
barriers to carpooling. For all interviews, a semi-structured interview style was used 
to ensure consistency while also allowing participants the freedom to express their 
thoughts in detail. 

### Convenience in pickup and punctuality are important for ideal carpooling.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: ResearchInsight1,
            alt: "Sketch of Alternative options to proceed for late rider",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Alternative options to proceed for late rider"
    }
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our initial understanding of an ideal carpooling situation was limited to pickup locations 
being close to one another and matching based on similar schedules. This insight we gained 
from one of our interviews showed us that punctuality and trust was also a key factor in an 
ideal carpooling situation. One interviewee noted that “making sure time is established and 
they are punctual” as an important factor to continuing a carpool arrangement. This insight 
gave us a lead on a potential design task we could focus on, which was handling riders 
who are running late or are consistently late.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### People are more motivated to carpool with others they know. 

Initially, the concept of carpooling seemed very similar to UberPool or any rideshare application. 
Users receive a carpooling arrangement based on location and estimated time of arrival. 
There was an oversight in compatibility between drivers and riders. During a pair interview, 
one interviewee noted that successful recurring carpool arrangements require good relationships 
between all members of the carpool. This insight was important in shaping our final design to 
incorporate carpool matching not only based on location and time but also similar 
interests and riding habits.

### Unexpected events and commitments require flexibility in commuting schedules

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: ResearchInsight2,
            alt: "Sketch of Reporting problem for late driver to notify riders",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Reporting problem for late driver to notify riders. "
    }
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

One interviewee noted unpredictable schedule changes due to having to not only commute to 
school but also their job off-campus. Our final design takes this insight into account by 
integrating an unexpected events feature in the case that drivers cannot provide carpooling 
for any last-minute reasons. This differed from our initial idea that riders would 
completely cancel rides when experiencing an unexpected event. This insight allowed drivers 
flexibility to delay a ride instead of canceling it altogether. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>


## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Using the insights from our design research, we were able to pinpoint the specific features 
the app should include. To express these features and their interactions, 
we chose to focus on the following two primary tasks: 

1. Rider Delay Handling for Drivers
2. Driver Delay Handling for Riders

We specifically chose these tasks in order to demonstrate the app’s functionality for common edge 
cases or exceptions (i.e. a driver or rider being late), which would disrupt the ideal flow of 
carpooling. For each task walkthrough, we created low-fidelity sketches, later transforming it 
into a paper prototype. Once we developed the paper prototype for each walkthrough, we underwent 
several rounds of both heuristic evaluation and usability testing. Evaluators were asked to use 
Nielsen’s Heuristics for UI design and usability tester to use the paper prototype as they would 
in the task situations.

From these evaluations, we derived the following three key insights:

### Driver Grace Period Flexibility

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: IterativeInsight1Pic1,
            alt: "Before: Lack of grace period flexibility",
        },
        {
            src: IterativeInsight1Pic2,
            alt: "After: Updated interface to provide grace period flexibility",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Updated interface to provide grace period flexibility." +
        "   (Left Picture) Before (Right Picture) After"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In the original design, drivers only had access to the Auto-Suspend feature for determining 
their rider late tolerance. It was only until after the preset grace period passed that the 
driver would be given options to choose the next action. However, in the usability tests, 
a key insight we discovered was that a driver’s late tolerance could change daily or even 
every ride. In order to give the driver more freedom, in addition to the Auto-Suspend feature, 
we provided a “time-of-error” option, which allows the driver to manually select their late 
tolerance the instant they have arrived at the pickup location. This allows drivers to have 
more freedom, rather than feeling obligated to wait due to settings that were saved way in advance. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Unclear Understanding of “Auto-Suspend” Feature


<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: IterativeInsight2Pic1,
            alt: "Before: Unclear Autosuspend Feature",
        },
        {
            src: IterativeInsight2Pic2,
            alt: "After: Improved consistency for pickup screen",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Adjusting late tolerance level and auto-suspend feature in driver profile" +
        "   (Left Picture) Before (Right Picture) After"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In our initial app prototype, we wanted to give the drivers flexibility and boundaries to set for their 
driver profile. We implemented an “Auto-Suspend” feature, which allows drivers to choose how long they’d 
be willing to wait for a rider upon arrival. However, many of our evaluators shared that this terminology 
was both unclear and app-specific. In our design iteration, we maintained the “Auto-Suspend” feature, 
however, we included an information pop up that explains its functionality to clear up any confusion. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Enhance Interface Consistency

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: IterativeInsight3Pic1,
            alt: "Before: Lack of consistency for pickup screen",
        },
        {
            src: IterativeInsight3Pic2,
            alt: "After: Improved consistency for pickup screen",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Improved consistency for pickup screen  " + 
        "    (Left Picture) Before (Right Picture) After"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Consistency was another key insight derived from the evaluations. In the original prototype, 
there were different icons and terminology used that were ultimately the same feature. 
This not only caused visual discrepancies, but also created usage confusion. Similarly, 
some features allowed users to modify settings or times, however, they lacked any 
confirmation or save button. For drivers, this interface would be more difficult to navigate, 
as it is easy to misselect. To iterate upon this, we ensured terminology was consistent 
across all interfaces, added in escape features, and created clear identifiers for what 
happens if a user modifies something.
