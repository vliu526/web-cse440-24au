Many dog owners struggle to effectively respond to and manage their dogs' emotional and reactive
behaviors, particularly in high-stress or unexpected situations such as barking at other dog or
behaving abnormally in unfamiliar environments. This issue stems from a lack of tools to help owners
interpret and address their dogs’ behaviors in real-time, compounded by limited opportunities to
learn from these situations to prevent recurrence. This creates challenges in both immediate intervention
and long-term behavior management, leaving owners feeling unprepared and dogs more anxious.
</ProjectImageBlock>
Our approach emphasizes equipping dog owners with the means to respond to immediate behavioral
challenges and reflect on those scenarios for deeper understanding. By focusing on both the reactive
and proactive aspects of behavior management, the design ensures that owners are not only able to
address a situation as it arises but also gain insights into potential triggers and alternatives
for future prevention. This dual focus helps build owners’ confidence in navigating complex
behavioral challenges while fostering a stronger connection with their pets.

## Design Walkthrough

The focus tasks—practicing skills to interpret emotional cues and supporting in-the-moment crisis
response—align perfectly with DawgSense's dual AR and VR capabilities. The VR practice mode enables
the reflective learning by allowing users to replay past crises and revisit previously encountered
scenarios, learning to identify and interpret signs of anxiety, stress, or aggression in a safe
environment. The AR mode on Orion glasses enables real-time detection of behavioral cues and
crisis triggers during live interactions with the dog, guiding the user to de-escalate or manage
situations effectively as they happen. Together, these tasks create a well-rounded system that not
only enhances immediate response but also builds foundational knowledge and confidence in understanding
dog behavior. The synergy between this design and the focus tasks lies in how AR and VR complement
each other to offer hands-on learning and real-time support, making it easier for dog owners to
confidently manage their pets’ behaviors in various real-world contexts.

    }}
    caption={
        "Select Mode to Start"
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"1200px"}
>
</ProjectImageBlock>

### Support in-the-moment response to the crisis

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t11,
        alt: "Task 1 Monitoring",
    }}
    caption={
        "Monitoring and Real-Time Analysis Initialization"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Upon activating the monitoring function (AR mode), a pop-up notification “Analyzing in Real-Time” and visual
clue of dog’s tail movement status appear. This assures the user that system is actively scanning their
dog’s behaviors and environmental triggers.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t12,
        alt: "Task 1 Detection",
    }}
    caption={
        "Crisis Detection and Warning Message"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

When unusual behavior is detected, such as rapid tail wagging or stiff posture, the system can recognize
these early warning signs and alerts the user with a warning message “Unusual Behavior Detected”. This
message is accompanied by a prompt asking the user to confirm the system’s detection.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t13,
        alt: "Task 1 Suggestion",
    }}
    caption={
        "Suggested interventions and Crisis De-Escalation"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Once a crisis is confirmed, the system presents a series of tailored suggestions to help de-escalate
the situation. These suggestions may include actions like guiding the dog to a calm space, offering a
distraction, or using specific calming commands.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t14,
        alt: "Task 1 Post Intervention",
    }}
    caption={
        "Post-Intervention Feedback and Confirmation"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Once the suggested intervention is completed, the system prompts the user to evaluate their dog’s current
state to adapt dynamically to the outcome, offering further suggestions if necessary.


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Practice skills interpreting dog’s emotional triggers and responses to prevent crisis from occurring

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t21,
        alt: "Task 2 Scenario Selection",
    }}
    caption={
        "Scenario Selection and Initial Setup"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Upon launching the system to practice mode (VR mode), users can choose a crisis scenario based on previously
recorded incidents.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t22,
        alt: "Task 2 Video Watching",
    }}
    caption={
        "Emotion and Trigger Recognition in Simulated Videos"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Once a scenario is selected, users watch a simulated VR video of the incident, observing the dog’s behavior in
real time. The system then prompts users to identify the dog’s emotional state, such as nervousness or fear, and
the potential triggers causing these emotions.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t23,
        alt: "Task 2 Feedback",
    }}
    caption={
        "Feedback and Learning Support"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

After users submit their response, the system provides immediate feedback, highlighting whether the correct emotion
and trigger were identified. If any triggers were missed, the system offers a list of potential triggers with
explanations to enhance user understanding and learning.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t24,
        alt: "Task 2 Report",
    }}
    caption={
        "Performance Report and Improvement Suggestions"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

At the end of the session, users receive a personalized report detailing their performance. The report highlights key
achievements, such as correctly identifying emotions and triggers, and offers suggestions for improvement, like focusing
on more nuanced behavioral cues earlier.

## Design Research and Key Insights

The goal of our design research was to understand the challenges dog owners face
in interpreting and managing their pets' emotional and reactive behaviors. We
aimed to identify gaps in current solutions and explore how real-time emotional
monitoring could enhance behavior management. Our primary method was conducted
interviews with three participants: a dog owner, a veterinarian, and a dog trainer,
each providing unique perspectives on dog behavior, training, and management.
These participants were selected for their diverse experiences, ensuring a holistic
view of the challenges faced. Interviews were chosen to allow flexibility in exploring
topics like emotional cues, behavioral management, and training needs. This approach
 provided actionable insights that informed our design decisions.

 <ProjectImageBlock

    }}
    caption={
        "Categorize dog training and owner support tools by effort level and impact, ranging from low-effort community features to high-effort, high-impact training tools."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"1000px"}
>
</ProjectImageBlock>

### Real-time Emotional Monitoring Enables Timely Interventions

Interviews revealed that dog owners struggle to recognize early signs of stress or
anxiety in their pets, often leading to delayed responses that exacerbate reactive
behaviors. For instance, a trainer mentioned, “It’s hard to know what’s going on
in her mind until it’s too late, and by then, she’s already reacting.” This insight
highlighted the importance of real-time tools for detecting subtle cues like tucked
tails or pinned ears. Incorporating this into our design, we prioritized features
like AR-driven real-time behavior analysis to guide owners in preventing crises
before they escalate.

### Owner Education Requires Long-Term, Multidimensional Approaches

Participants emphasized the need for comprehensive education on dog behavior. While
training videos and apps provide some support, they lack personalized guidance
tailored to specific dogs and contexts. The veterinarian noted that “dog owners
need to learn how to manage their own emotions” since stress can transfer to pets.
This insight shaped our focus on combining immediate support with long-term learning
tools, such as VR scenarios for reflective practice, helping owners understand their
dog's triggers and manage interactions proactively.

### Behavioral and Health Patterns Are Interconnected

Our research uncovered that behavioral issues are often linked to health conditions.
For example, the veterinarian explained that “aggressive behavior may stem from pain
or hormonal imbalances,” emphasizing the need for tools that integrate behavioral and
health monitoring. This led us to design features that correlate physiological changes
with behavior, enabling owners to identify and address potential health concerns alongside
emotional triggers.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process for the Dawgsense MR project began with a clear focus on
enhancing the interaction between dog owners and their pets through advanced AR and
VR technologies. Initially, we engaged in paper prototyping and user story mapping
to outline the essential functionalities—real-time crisis response and behavioral
practice in controlled environments. This phase was instrumental in defining the dual
focus tasks of the project: enabling in-the-moment crisis management and facilitating
behavioral training through replayable scenarios.

Following the initial prototyping, we conducted a series of inspections and usability
tests to refine our design. These evaluations provided crucial insights into user needs
and system performance, particularly highlighting the importance of seamless integration
between the AR and VR components. The feedback led to significant mockup changes, including
the integration of functionalities into a single workflow and the introduction of a
comprehensive "History & Reports" section to enhance user engagement and experience.

Throughout this process, each iteration brought us closer to a design that not only
fill the hole in existing designs but also resonated with the user’s daily experiences
and challenges. The iterative cycles of designing, testing, and refining allowed us to
adapt our approach dynamically, ensuring that the final product—Dawgsense MR—was both
intuitive and effective in helping dog owners manage and understand their pets'
behavior in real-time and through reflective practice.

### Integrating Two Functionality Workflow into One Homepage

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insights1before,
            alt: "separate interface",
            caption: "Before: Two separate homepages were designed for each focused task. "
        },
        {
            src: insights1after,
            alt: "integrated homepage",
            caption: "After: Both focused tasks have been integrated into a single homepage. " +
                     "Users can now choose between the two modes."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"350px"}
>

In our initial paper prototype, users were required to navigate between two distinct
interfaces to accomplish both of our focused tasks, which significantly disrupted the
user experience. This separation not only created confusion but also introduced unnecessary
complexity into the usability of the system. Observations during usability testing indicated
that this disjointed interaction model led to frustration and a decreased likelihood of task
completion.

To address these issues, our digital mockup underwent a redesign where both key
functionalities—"Monitor in Real-Time" and "Practice Your Skills"—were integrated
on the homepage. This strategic integration fosters a more cohesive and streamlined
user experience by eliminating the need to switch contexts. Users can now seamlessly
choose between immediate assistance or proactive skill enhancement without navigating
away from the main interface. This design choice not only simplifies the navigation
process but also enhances the overall accessibility of the application. It allows
for a more personalized and intuitive interaction with the system, significantly
improving user engagement and satisfaction. By consolidating these features, the
redesigned interface directly supports users in efficiently achieving their intended
goals, thereby enhancing the practical utility and user-friendliness of our application.

### Empowering User Experience with Intuitive Navigation and Responsive Controls

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insights2before,
            alt: "interface without exit/back button.",
        },
        {
            src: insights2after,
            alt: "interface with exit/back button.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Before the change, there is no button to go back or exit. A Back Button was added to allow users to navigate " +
        ", and an Exit Button was added to provide a clear way to leave the session entirely."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our heuristic evaluations and usability tests highlighted significant gaps in our
prototype’s user interface, particularly the lack of essential navigation and
directive elements. For example, once users accessed the interface, they encountered
no directive prompts and found it difficult to modify or cancel their selections
in practicing options like "Shaking" or "Dog Bark." This oversight limited users'
ability to adjust or withdraw actions, leading to frustration and a diminished
sense of control over the application, contrary to the User Control and Freedom
heuristic.

To address these issues, we enhanced the design to include backward navigation
and undo functionalities, thereby empowering users with the flexibility to
easily navigate back or terminate actions when they change their minds.
Additionally, we introduced a 'continue' button on the homepage and a new
section detailing various operational modes. These enhancements make the progression
steps and available functionalities clear, significantly improving the user experience
by ensuring consistency and simplifying navigation. Together, these improvements have
transformed our design into a more user-friendly and responsive tool, enhancing both its
functional integrity and user satisfaction.

### Adding Detailed Feedback and Performance Summary

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insights3before,
            alt: "interface with vague post-practice summary",
            caption: "Before: Post-practice feedback screen displaying the vague 'Good Job' message " +
                     "without any additional description or summary."
        },
        {
            src: insights3after,
            alt: "interface with detailed post-practice summary",
            caption: "After: Post-practice feedback screen displaying the detailed " +
                     "summary of user performance and further improvements."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>

The usability tests revealed that the feedback provided to users after completing practice sessions
was vague and lacked actionable insights. Users were presented with generic messages like "Good Job!"
without any detailed breakdown of their performance or suggestions for improvement. This lack of meaningful
feedback violated the Visibility of System Status and Feedback heuristic, as it failed to communicate to
users how well they performed and how they could improve. The absence of actionable information hindered
the learning process, leaving users unable to gauge their progress or identify areas requiring attention.

To address this shortfall, the feedback mechanism was overhauled to include both positive reinforcement
and constructive suggestions. Now, post-training feedback not only praises correct actions, such as
identifying early signs of anxiety with statements like "You identified early signs of anxiety correctly.
Great work!", but it also points out specific areas for improvement, such as "Focus on noticing tail
movements earlier," accompanied by actionable advice.
