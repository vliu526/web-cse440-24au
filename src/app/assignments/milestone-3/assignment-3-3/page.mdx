# Assignment 3.3: Design Presentations

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

In Class: Tuesday, October 29; Thursday, October 31; Friday, November 1

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to share your design research,
explore multiple potential design ideas,
and consider a direction to pursue in the remainder of your project.

Each design presentation scheduling slot is 20 minutes.
Plan for 15 minutes of discussion, with transition time before and after your discussion.
Staff will have reviewed your submission prior to this discussion,
so you should plan for this to be a discussion of your design direction.
If you have particular things you want to be sure to cover in discussion,
you should explicitly raise those as questions to the staff.

Groups are only expected to be present during their scheduled slot.
Groups may quietly use another portion of the room on the same day they are scheduled.
We ask that groups scheduled for another day meet elsewhere.

## Submission

Sign Up Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_2} />

Presentations will directly use the same Slides deck you prepared and submitted in Assignment 3.2.
You may continue to update those in-place in the Drive folder for course project files,
based on feedback or in preparing for discussion.
